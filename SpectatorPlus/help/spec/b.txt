Disables the no-clip mode.

This command wan only be used if you are currently
spectating and if the forced vanilla spectator mode
is not enabled.

It is here to be used as a workaround for a CraftBukkit/
Spigot bug: in some earlier versions (1.8.0), it was not
possible to execute something when a player clicked on
his inventory, if he was in vanilla spectator mode. This
is no longer the case in recent CraftBukkit/Spigot version,
so ignore this command and use the GUI (except if you want
to use this).
