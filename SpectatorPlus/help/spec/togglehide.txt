Hides a player from the spectators.

This command allows you to hide a player from the
spectators, even if the mode allows him to be seen
ยง7(see /spec help mode)ยงr (excepted for the players
with a sufficient permission).

It's a toggle, so if the player was hidden he will
become visible.

Spectators with the permission spectate.admin.hide.see
(by default, operators) will still be able to see hidden
players. Such players will be prefixed with a HIDDEN tag
in the teleportation GUI.
