Manages arenas.

This command provides options to create, update,
delete and list arenas.
It is only useful if the spectating mode is set
to ARENA §7(see /spec help mode)§r.

An arena is a three-dimensional space in the game;
while spectating, a player have to select an arena
using the arena selector GUI (next to his teleporter)
and, when selected, he can only see in the teleportation
GUI the players inside the bounds of the selected
arena.

An arena can have a lobby, were spectators are
teleported when they select the arena.

To create an arena, use §6/spec arena add§r. You
can either specify bounds coordinates directly, or
create the arena in a WorldEdit-like manner, by
punching the corners, if you execute only §6/spec
§6arena add <name>§r without coordinates.

Use the other commands (see above) to set the lobby
or delete an arena.
