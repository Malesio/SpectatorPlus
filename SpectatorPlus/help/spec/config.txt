Displays or updates the configuration.

This command displays the configuration values, if used
without a new value (/spec config <path>), or updates
the configuration entries directly from the game.

The updates are instantaneously applied: as example, if
you change the item representing the teleporter, all the
spectators will see this item change in their inventory.
Or, if you disable the spectators tools, all players with
the tools GUI opened will have it force-closed.

§oThis is basically an interface to the config.yml file.
§oBut please note that some values cannot be updated, like
§othe lists.
